File Structure Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was broken up into three separate components: the user interface (ATM.java),
the business logic (Logic.java), and the back-end database manager (Database.java). The reason
for this was to provide abstraction at a few different levels to make coding and testing
easier. I would've wrote interfaces as well, but considering the size and scope of this
assignment, I thought it would be a waste of time trying to make it more flexible than it
needs to be.
